set A;            # airplanes
set F;            # flights
set CONN within F cross F;

##### Parameters #####

# Flight data
param origin{F}, symbolic;    # origin airport code
param dest  {F}, symbolic;    # destination airport code
param dep   {F}, >= 0;        # departure time in minutes
param arr   {F}, >= 0;        # arrival  time in minutes
param Reach {A,F} binary;

# Plane data
param pos0  {A}, symbolic;    # each planeâ€™s starting airport
param lease {A} >= 0;         # leasing revenue if plane is unused
param rev   {F,A} >= 0;       # revenue of assigning plane a to flight f
param cost  {F,A} >= 0;       # cost   of assigning plane a to flight f

##### Decision Variables #####

var x {f in F, a in A: Reach[a,f] = 1} binary;  # 1 if flight f is flown by plane a
var z {a in A, f in F: Reach[a,f] = 1} binary;  # 1 if flight f is the *first* flight for plane a
var y{a in A}         binary;  # 1 if plane a is leased out (not used)

##### Objective #####

maximize Profit:
    sum {a in A, f in F: Reach[a,f]=1}
      (rev[f,a] - cost[f,a]) * x[f,a]
  + sum {a in A} lease[a] * y[a]
;
